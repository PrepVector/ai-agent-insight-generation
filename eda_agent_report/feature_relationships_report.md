### Question 1
- **What is the correlation coefficient between 'cpu_usage' and 'memory_usage'?**

#### Code
```python
correlation_q1 = df['cpu_usage'].corr(df['memory_usage'])
print(f"Correlation coefficient between 'cpu_usage' and 'memory_usage': {correlation_q1}")

plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
sns.scatterplot(x='cpu_usage', y='memory_usage', data=df)
plt.title("CPU Usage vs Memory Usage")
plt.xlabel("CPU Usage")
plt.ylabel("Memory Usage")
plot_path_q1 = 'eda_agent_report/images/Feature_Relationships_q1_analysis.png'
plt.savefig(plot_path_q1, bbox_inches='tight', dpi=300)
plt.close()
```

#### Code Output
```
Correlation coefficient between 'cpu_usage' and 'memory_usage': 0.0508688246729876
Plot saved to: eda_agent_report/images/Feature_Relationships_q1_analysis.png
```

#### Detailed Analysis
The correlation coefficient between 'cpu_usage' and 'memory_usage' is approximately 0.051, indicating a very weak positive linear relationship between these two variables.
